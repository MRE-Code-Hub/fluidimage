==========

We need a good software to compute PIV...

What do we need?
----------------

- easy installation

- cross-platform

- no need for Matlab

- better written nearly all in Python (Cython or Pythran ok)

- well tested

- well documented
  
- efficient

  * able to use GPU
  
  * parallel, running on cluster

- GUI (Qt)

  * display images (zoom, colorbar, colormaps, info on a pixel)

  * display vectors (and information on a selected vector)
