UVmat uses thin plate spline for the interpolation and the calculation
of the derivative of the fields.

Files (and functions) in UVmat related to that
----------------------------------------------

base functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- tps_coeff.m
- tps_eval.m
- tps_eval_dxy.m

These functions are implemented exactly as in Matlab in the file
tps_base.py.
  
example
~~~~~~~

- test_tps.m

This script has been translated in bad Python in the file try_tps.py.

Others
------

- filter_tps.m
- tps_coeff_field.m
- set_subdomains.m
- filter_tps.m
- calc_field_tps.m
- calc_field_interp.m
